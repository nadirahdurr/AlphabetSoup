## Technologies

**This project was creating using Jupyter notebook along with the following libaries and dependancies:**

* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)  - manipulation tool used for data analysis 

* [pathlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html) - for file system paths 

* [tensorflow](https://matplotlib.org/) - provides a collection of workflows to develop and train models

* [sklearn](https://matplotlib.org/) - tool for predictive data analysis

## Installation Guide 

**Open JupyterLab and import the following**

`import pandas as pd`

`from pathlib import Path`

`import tensorflow as tf`

`from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense`

`from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential`

`from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split`

`from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler,OneHotEncoder`

## Usage

Run each step to see the binary classification model .
